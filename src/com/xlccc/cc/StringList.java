/**
 * This is the interface you must implement to complete the assignment.
 * <p>
 * The interface defines the functionality required by a very simple
 * linked list for storing Strings in sorted lexicographic order.
 * Rather than providing an iterator (like the linked list in the Java API),
 * this simple linked list just provides direct access to the individual
 * nodes in the list.
 * <p>
 * This linked list also differs from the one in the Java API in
 * that it does not allow for duplicates of items to be stored. Instead,
 * a counter is associated with each node that gives the number
 * of copies of the item at that node.
 * <p>
 * It is part of COMPX201-20X Assignment 2.
 * This interface should not be modified in any way.
